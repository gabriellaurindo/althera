## Althera 3.0.0 — Choose your Hero

Minecraft 1.21.1 · NeoForge 21.1.219 · requires GeckoLib 4.7+

> Network protocol changed: clients and servers must both run 3.0.0.

### Added
- **Skill HUD**: slots next to the hotbar for Overdrive (J), Revive (K), Heal (V) and Explosion (U). Each slot shows
  its key, the remaining time while the skill is active or on cooldown, and grays out when you lack mana or Command
  Seal charges. Ultimates already used today show a red ✕. Remaining Command Seal charges appear above the slots.
  The HUD follows the hero HUD visibility setting.
- **Choose your Hero** screen: players without a hero now pick their first one instead of getting a random roll. It
  opens on login (or when you press the summon or hero key) and shows each hero with an animated preview, rank,
  class, description and class stats. Every hero with its own model, texture and animations can be chosen; for now
  that is Aria (Saber) and Clare (Assassin).
  - **This version only:** players who already have a hero also get the screen once on login and can switch to
    another hero, keeping their hero level and XP (or keep their current one). Closing the screen keeps your hero
    and shows it again on your next login until you decide. This one-time switch will be removed in the next
    version.
- All hero ranks are enabled: F, E, D, C, B, A, S and EX, each with its own roll chance. Only heroes with their own
  model, texture and animations can be rolled, so for now every roll gives one of the two EX heroes, Aria or Clare;
  new heroes join the roll as their visuals are added.
- **Clare**, a new EX hero of the new Assassin class: a gothic heroine with long silver hair, crimson eyes, X
  hairpins, a black and crimson dress with a lace jabot, detached sleeves, thigh-high buckled boots, a torn
  crimson-lined overskirt and a gothic rapier with a ruby on the guard. Her hair, locks and overskirt sway as she
  moves, and she has her own idle, walk, attack, ultimate and death animations. During her ultimate a spinning red
  magic circle, about 4 blocks wide, opens at her feet.
- **Assassin class**: fast and hard-hitting but fragile (less health and armor, more attack and speed). Strong
  against Casters, weak against Shielders.
- `/althera_hero divine` (cheats) is enabled again: assigns a random Divine hero, when one is available.

### Changed
- **Notice:** hero models, textures and animations are work in progress. They can and will change constantly between
  versions until they reach their final quality.
- **Aria** has a brand new model, texture and animations: a paladin with a long cape, flowing hair and ponytail, a
  detailed face, and new idle, walk, attack, ultimate and death animations. During her ultimate, golden wings sprout
  behind her and then fade away.
- Aria and Clare are now about as tall as the player, and the hero hitbox matches the player's (1.8 blocks). The hero
  screens still show them at full size. Datapack heroes can set an optional `scale` in their JSON to match.
- The hero's name no longer floats above its head.
- Redesigned the hero screen (G): larger preview with the name, rank and class under it, cleaner level, XP and health
  bars, and damage, armor and interventions left. The settings tab explains each option, and "Disable Saves" is now
  called "Disable interventions". Both hero screens have an x button to close them.
- New look for the mana bar: framed bar with a blue gradient, a soft shine, 10% marks and smooth animation, with a
  light trail showing the mana you just spent. The value now sits to the right of the bar, and the frame pulses red
  when you have less than 20 mana (the cost to summon).
- The ritual now swaps your hero: it rolls a new hero, never the one you already have (rank chances still apply).
  Your hero level and XP carry over, and the new hero starts at full health. If no other hero is available, the
  ritual fails without consuming the diamond block.
- Explosion ultimate: while channeling, the hero plays its ultimate animation (when its model has one) instead of
  getting a white glowing outline.
- Heroes with a death animation (Aria, Clare) now collapse to the ground on defeat. Heroes without one keep the classic
  sideways tip-over.

### Fixed
- Summoning or performing the ritual with no hero available now shows a message instead of crashing.
- Hero datapacks: a hero without `rank` now fails to load with a clear error instead of an invalid default.
- Dedicated servers: the summon HUD, the hero screen (G) and custom hero models/textures (e.g. Aria) now work for
  every player. Hero stats shown on the client also match the server again. Heroes are re-sent after `/reload`.
